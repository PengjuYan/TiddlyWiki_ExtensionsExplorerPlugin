This plugin for TiddlyWiki 2.x introduces auto-checking extensions'
updates and a UI to explore, install, and update extensions.

The exploration functionality is currently at a rather early stage;
notifying and updating, on the other hand, work out of the box for all plugins.

See the comments in the plugin for more details.
